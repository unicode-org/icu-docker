# icu-dev

> ICU development inside Docker

This is a set of dockerfiles and a Makefile to develop with ICU (against Ubuntu, Fedora, anything else you can run from docker).
It sets up `ccache` to share cached compiler output in `./tmp/.ccache` and expects an ICU source directory under `./src/icu`

## Customization

You can create a `Makefile.local` that can point to a different docker-compose.yaml:

```
# Makefile.local
DOCKER_COMPOSE=docker-compose -f local-docker-compose.yml
```

## Usage

- install [Docker](http://docker.io)
- bring in ICU source
  ```
  cd src
  git clone --branch main --depth 1 https://github.com/unicode-org/icu.git
  cd icu
  git lfs fetch
  git lfs checkout
  cd ../..
  ```
- run tests
  ```
  make check-all
  ```
- build binaries
  ```
  make dist
  ```         
- sort into `dist/icu4c-*/*`

  The files should include the version label such as "69rc" for the release candidate of ICU version 69. The general availability for that would be "69.1". 
  ```
  ./sort-out-dist.sh
  ls -l dist/icu4c-*
  ```
- optional: Link `src/` to `/src` on your system

  This symlink will make error messages from inside the container usable on your local system, of the form: `Error in /src/icu/somefile.cpp`.
  ```
  sudo ln -sv `pwd`/{src,dist} /
  ```

- Perform some command line builds to verify the release.
  ```
  $ docker-compose run ubuntu bash
  # This creates a temporary docker shell with a name such as 'build@59b67f6c5058:~'
  build@59b67f6c5058:~$ /src/icu/icu4c/source/configure
  # This will show the ICU version number of the release just created.
  build@59b67f6c5058:~$ make check  # To run all ICU4C tests
  ...
  build@59b67f6c5058:~$ exit  # To leave the docker shell
  ```
